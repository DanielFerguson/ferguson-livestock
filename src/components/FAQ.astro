const faqs = [
	{
		question: "How does ordering work?",
		answer: "Once you're on our wait list, we'll text you when we're about to process a cow (typically 2 weeks notice). You'll get first dibs on the available boxes. Pay online, and we'll personally deliver to your door on the scheduled delivery day.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do you deliver to my area?",
		answer: "We deliver to Ballarat and surrounding suburbs, including Snake Valley, Smythesdale, Buninyong, Sebastopol, Wendouree, and surrounding areas. If you're unsure, pop in your postcode when you register and we'll confirm.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is the beef really grass-fed and hormone-free?",
		answer: "Absolutely. Our Murray Grey cattle graze on our Snake Valley pastures year-round. No feedlots, no grain finishing, no added hormones—ever. We're happy to show you around the farm if you'd like to see for yourself.",
	},
	{
		question: "How much does a box cost?",
		answer: "We'll share exact pricing when we text you about each drop. Our prices are competitive with quality butchers but you're getting farm-direct freshness and complete traceability. Plus, delivery is always free.",
	},
	{
		question: "How is the beef packaged?",
		answer: "All cuts are professionally vacuum-sealed and packed in custom insulated boxes with ice packs. It'll stay perfectly chilled during delivery and is ready to go straight into your freezer.",
	},
	{
		question: "What if I'm not home during delivery?",
		answer: "No worries! Just let us know a safe spot to leave it (like an esky on the porch) and we'll make sure it's secure. With our insulated packaging, it'll stay cold for hours.",
	},
