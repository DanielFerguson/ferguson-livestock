const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How does ordering work?",
        answer: "Once you're on our wait list, we'll text you when we're about to process a cow (typically 2 weeks notice). You'll get first dibs on the available boxes. Pay online, and we'll personally deliver to your door on the scheduled delivery day.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you deliver to my area?",
        answer: "We deliver to Ballarat and surrounding suburbs, including Snake Valley, Smythesdale, Buninyong, Sebastopol, Wendouree, and surrounding areas. If you're unsure, pop in your postcode when you register and we'll confirm.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is the beef raised?",
        answer: "Our Murray Grey cattle are pasture-raised right here in Snake Valley. They spend their lives grazing on open paddocks—no feedlots, no added hormones, ever. During dry periods, we may supplement with hay or grain to keep them healthy, but they're always on pasture.",
    },
    {
        question: "What cuts are included in a box?",
        answer: "Each box contains a variety of cuts including steaks (scotch fillet, porterhouse, rump), roasts, mince, sausages, and slow-cook cuts like osso buco and chuck. The exact mix varies depending on the beast, but you'll get a good selection of premium and everyday cuts.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does the beef last in the freezer?",
        answer: "Vacuum-sealed beef will keep in your freezer for 12-18 months without losing quality. Once thawed, we recommend cooking it within 3-5 days. Most families find a box lasts them 2-3 months depending on how often they eat beef.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I choose specific cuts?",
        answer: "Our boxes come as a set mix of cuts from each beast—we can't do custom selections as it wouldn't be fair to other customers. However, the variety means you'll get to try different cuts and cooking methods, and most families love the surprise of it.",
    },
    {
        question: "How often do you process cattle?",
        answer: "We typically process every few months, depending on when our cattle are ready. We're not a big operation, so we focus on quality over quantity. Join the wait list and we'll text you when the next drop is coming up.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you sell individual cuts?",
        answer: "We only sell beef in boxes, not individual cuts. This ensures nothing goes to waste and keeps our operation simple. Each box gives you a great variety of cuts at a fair price.",
    },
    {
        question: "What makes Murray Grey beef special?",
        answer: "Murray Greys are an Australian heritage breed developed right here in Victoria. They're known for their calm temperament, natural marbling, and ability to thrive on pasture. Less stress means more tender beef, and their genetics produce beautifully flavoured meat without intensive finishing.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is the beef aged?",
        answer: "Yes, our beef is hung for a minimum of 7-10 days after processing. This dry-aging period allows the natural enzymes to tenderise the meat and develop deeper flavour. It's one of the things that sets quality beef apart from supermarket meat.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much does a box cost?",
        answer: "We'll share exact pricing when we text you about each drop. Our prices are competitive with quality butchers but you're getting farm-direct freshness and complete traceability. Plus, delivery is always free.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is the beef packaged?",
        answer: "All cuts are professionally vacuum-sealed and packed in custom insulated boxes with ice packs. It'll stay perfectly chilled during delivery and is ready to go straight into your freezer.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm not home during delivery?",
        answer: "No worries! Just let us know a safe spot to leave it (like an esky on the porch) and we'll make sure it's secure. With our insulated packaging, it'll stay cold for hours.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I join the wait list?",
        answer: "Just fill in the form at the top of this page with your name, phone number, and postcode. We'll add you to our list and text you when the next drop is coming up. No commitment required—you can pass on any drop that doesn't suit you.",
    },
